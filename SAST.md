## What is SAST ?
========================


SAST (Static Application Security Testing) 

It is a type of security testing that analyzes your source code, bytecode, or binary code for vulnerabilities without executing the application. 

It is a built-in security feature that automatically scans your source code for vulnerabilities during the CI/CD pipeline, without executing the code.

It helps developers identify security issues early in the development lifecycle.
